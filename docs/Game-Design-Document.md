Genre: Bureaucracy Simulation / FPS Tower Defense Hybrid
Platform: PC

PROJECT SUMMARY

This work outlines the technical and narrative framework of a video game focused on dark comedy, depicting afterlife as a cold and soulless corporate structure. The player embodies a temporary clerk in the "Final Judgment Bureau," subjected to a 10-day trial period.

NARRATIVE AND ATMOSPHERE

Our character is a "Inspector" whose moral record (sins and virtues) is perfectly balanced—a rare situation that makes them part of the bureaucratic mechanism in Purgatory.
• Setting: Final Judgment Bureau (A claustrophobic, dim complex filled with old-fashioned office equipment).
• Goal: Collect merit points over 10 days to be promoted to upper management (Heaven).
• Tone: Built on strict corporate language, meaningless bureaucratic obstacles, and absurd moral judgments for dark humor.

CORE GAME LOOP

3.1. Daytime Phase: Document Inspection
• Mechanic: First-person perspective desktop paperwork management.
• Task: Review souls' files (age, cause of death, moral record) to decide "Up" or "Down."
• Interaction: Physical interaction with stamps, files, and communication tools on the desk.
3.2. Nighttime Phase: Evacuation Defense
• Mechanic: FPS + Tower Defense hybrid in the corridors.
• Task: Prevent souls from escaping Hell by setting traps, barricades, and fighting.
• Interaction: Use merit-bought items (weapons, barriers) with physics-based placement.
3.3. Progression and Economy
• Merit points from daytime decisions buy nighttime items.
• Difficulty ramps: Bureaucratic complications (machine breakdowns, inflation) increase over days.
• Endings: Promotion to Heaven (success) or exile to H-Line (failure).
[Additional Notes: The game emphasizes replayability with random absurd moral judgments and escalating absurdity, like office malfunctions and sabotage.]
